# Week six notes

what approach best suits the story/message/finding that you're trying to convey?

- Virginia Woolf's diaries from 1924 to 1929 while writing and publishing her novel, To The Lighthouse
### guiding research questions
- focus on the content, themes of the diary
- use corpus linguistics to analyse her process of writing
- how did Woolf's process invlove the people around her and the society that she was living through
- today, she is regarded as a feminist inspiration in her writing. to what extent is that reflected in her diary?
- how does Woolf write about emotion? 

- using python to create urls
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4288973/whats-the-difference-between-s-and-d-in-python-string-formatting
- got an error message
- made my own urls.txt file by copying one link and then using regex to change the endings for each page
- ran through wget
- got rid of anything I didn't need
- tried to use a code in R to change all of my html files into txt files so that I could run it through AntConc later
- got an error message and none of the webpages made sense to me (math related)
  - thought that I was in over my head and decided to open the files and convert them by hand
- used RegEx to clean up the files, get rid of the html formatting things that I did not need

- `<br/>|&amp;|&nbsp;` replace with ` `
- `">|<br/>|<span.*">|</span>|&nbsp;|&amp;`
  - for example, one file looked like this before:
  - and like this after:
  
- downloading and cleaning up the data took the longest


- wget
- regex
- antconc
- topic models to get an overview of the themes
- some way of communicating my findings
