# Week six notes

what approach best suits the story/message/finding that you're trying to convey?


- using python to create urls
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4288973/whats-the-difference-between-s-and-d-in-python-string-formatting
- got an error message
- made my own urls.txt file by copying one link and then using regex to change the endings for each page
- ran through wget
- got rid of anything I didn't need
- `<br/>|&amp;|&nbsp;` replace with ` `
- `">|<br/>|<span.*">|</span>|&nbsp;|&amp;`


- wget
- regex
- antconc
- some way of communicating my findings
