# Week six journal

[a link to my static site](https://paula-rodrigo.github.io/woolfdiaries.github.io/)

This week, I created and analysed a corpus made up of Virginia Woolf's diary entries from 1924 to 1929, during the time that she was writing her book, *To the Lighthouse*. Examining the corpus using Antconc, topic models, and voyant found that the diaries revealed something about Woolf's writing process and the personal relationship she had with books and writing. The collocates for certain words in the diary reveals the nature of her connections with the people in her life, notably her husband, Leonard, and her lover, Vita Sackville-West. Looking up words like "my" and "I" also gave me a glimpse into how she saw herself. I created a static site where I communicated my findings. The site includes visualizations and interactive readings of the data through Voyant.

After this week, I definitely feel that my analysis was more exploratory than explanatory. Most of my time was spent cleaning up my data and getting it ready to examine. As such, I have much more of an appreciation for the work that goes into creating and collecting data to examine. I wish I had more time to go through the visualizations and word searches that I did so that I could come up with more fleshed-out results and explanations. I can see why Dr. Graham said that this week is more of a "first pass". After doing this, I can see that I need more data in the corpus to even try to answer the inital research guiding quesitons that I posed before starting. 


Digital history is a process of encountering a body of information that suggests 
a question or two to you and then cycling back to that body of information to better 
understand the question (we haven’t even got to an answer yet!). In so doing, you’ll 
discover that the information is messy, or in the not-quite-right format. 80% of our 
time, as digital historians, is just getting things into shape for us to begin our 
exploration! Reflect on Michelle Moravec’s own cycle of exploration and what that 
might imply for yours.

- wish i had more time to go through the visualizations and searches that I did to get more fleshed-out results
- very much a starting point
- need to get more data for the corpus if I were to go any further
